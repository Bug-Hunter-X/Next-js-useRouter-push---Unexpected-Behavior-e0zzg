# Next.js useRouter.push() Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue related to using `useRouter.push()` within an event handler in Next.js.  The problem arises when other actions are performed within the same handler, potentially leading to unexpected routing behaviors or errors.

## Bug Description

The application uses `useRouter.push()` to navigate to a new page. However, if additional actions are executed following the `router.push()` call, unexpected behavior may occur, such as the new page not rendering correctly or the application becoming unresponsive.  This is likely due to timing issues or unforeseen interactions between the routing and other operations within the handler.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Click the button. Observe any unexpected behavior or errors in the console.

## Solution

The solution may require separating the routing action from other actions within the event handler. This prevents race conditions that may cause unpredictable results.  We may also need to use promises or asynchronous methods appropriately to ensure one action completes before the next starts.   See `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.
